# Offset <!-- omit in toc -->


- Feature Name: `offset_curve`
- Start Date: 2022-11-11
- [Feature PR]

Proposal to add an Offset operation which allows linear geometry to be offset perpendicular to its direction based on the paper outlined below.

Note that the proposed `offset_curve` is different to a `buffer` operation.

## Offset Trait

Create a Trait called `OffsetCurve` in the `algorithms` module.

## Trait Implementations

- [X] `Line<T>`
- [X] `LineString<T>`
- [X] `MultiLineString<T>`
- [ ] `Triangle<T>`
- [ ] `Rectangle<T>`
- [ ] `Polygon<T>`
- [ ] `MultiPolygon<T>`
- [ ] ~~`Point<T>`~~ <br/>
  - [ ] ~~`MultiPoint<T>`~~
  - [ ] ~~`Geometry<T>`~~
  - [ ] ~~`GeometryCollection<T>`~~

> Note:
> Offset for `Point` Can't be defined without confusion.
> The user may expect the result to be one of the following:
> 
> 1. Return the input unchanged,
> 1. a translation (but in what direction?)
> 1. a circle (like a buffer, but as previously explained,
>    the `offset` operation is different to the `buffer` operation).
> 1. an empty `LineString` (wierd, yes, but this is actually what GEOS does ðŸ¤”)


For coordinate types

- [X] `where T:CoordFloat`
- [ ] `where T:CoordNum` (??? seems tricky)
  
## To Do / Limitations

Some may be removed during development

- [X] Change name from `Offset` to `OffsetCurve` to match terminology in `GEOS`
      and `jts`
- [ ] Make proper use of SimpleKernel / RobustKernel
- [X] Prevent execution when the specified offset distance is zero
- [X] Mitre-limit is implemented so that a LineString which doubles-back on
      itself will not produce an elbow at infinity
  - [ ] Make Mitre Limit configurable?
- [ ] Option to clip output such that non-adjacent line segments in the output
      are not self-intersecting.
- [ ] Handle closed shapes

### Algorithm 1 - Pre-Treatment
1. Pretreatment steps from the paper are not implemented... these mostly deal with arcs and malformed input geometry


### Algorithm 0.1 - Segment Offset

1. Create an empty `LineSegmentList` called `offset_segments`
1. For each `LineSegment` of `input_linestring`
   1. Take each segment `(a,b)` of `input_linestring` and compute the vector from the start to the end of the segment<br/>
      `ab = b - a`
   1. rotate this vector by -90 degrees to obtain the 'left normal'<br/>
      `ab_left = Vector2(-ab.y, ab.x)`
   1. normalise `ab_left` by dividing each component by the magnitude of `ab_left`.
   1. multiply the vector by the scalar `d` to obtain the `segment_offset_vector`
   1. add the `segment_offset_vector` to `a` and `b` to get `offset_a` and `offset_b`
   1. append `(offset_a, offset_b)` to `offset_segments`


### Algorithm 1 - Line Extension
4. Create an empty `LineString` called `raw_offset_ls`
1. Append `offset_segments[0][0]` to `raw_offset_ls`
1. For each pair of consecutive segments `(a,b),(c,d)` in `offset_segments`
   1. If `(a,b)` is co-linear with `(c,d)` then append `b` to raw_offset_ls, and go to the next pair of segments.
   1. Otherwise, find the intersection point `p` of the infinite lines that are collinear with `(a,b)` and `(c,d)`;<br>
      Pay attention to the location of `p` relative to each of the segments:
      1. if `p` is within the segment it is a *True Intersection Point* or **TIP**
      1. If `p` is outside the segment it is called a *False Intersection Point* or **FIP**.<br/>
         **FIP**s are further classified  as follows:
         - **Positive FIP** or **PFIP** if `p` is after the end of a segment, or
         - **Negative FIP** or **NFIP** if `p` is before the start of a segment.
   1. If `p` is a **TIP** for both `(a,b)` and `(c,d)` append `p` to `raw_offset_ls`
   1. If `p` is a **FIP** for both `(a,b)` and `(c,d)`
      1. If `p` is a **PFIP** for `(a,b)` then append `p`to `raw_offset_ls`
      1. Otherwise, append `b` then `c` to `raw_offset_ls`
   1. Otherwise, append `b` then `c` to `raw_offset_ls`
1. Remove zero length segments in `raw_offset_ls`

### Algorithm 4.1 - Dual Clipping - **(TODO: not yet implemented)**
8. Find `raw_offset_ls_twin` by repeating Algorithms 0.1 and 1 but offset the `input_linestring` in the opposite direction (`-d`)
1. Find `intersection_points` between
   1. `raw_offset_ls` and `raw_offset_ls`
   1. `raw_offset_ls` and `raw_offset_ls_twin`

1. Find `split_offset_mls` by splitting `raw_offset_ls` at each point in `intersection_points`
1. If `intersection_points` was empty, then add `raw_offset_ls` to `split_offset_mls` and skip to Algorithm 4.2.
1. Delete each `LineString` in `split_offset_mls` if it intersects the `input_linestring`<br>
   unless the intersection is with the first or last `LineSegment` of `input_linestring`
   1. If we find such an intersection point that *is* on the first or last `LineSegment` of `input_linestring`<br/>
   then add the intersection point to a list called `cut_targets`

### Algorithm 4.1.2 - Cookie Cutter - **(TODO: not yet implemented)**
13. For each point `p` in `cut_targets`
   1. construct a circle of diameter `d` with its center at `p`
   1. delete all parts of any linestring in `split_offset_mls` which falls within this circle
1. Empty the `cut_targets` list

### Algorithm 4.1.3 - Proximity Clipping **(TODO: not yet implemented)**
17. For each linestring `item_ls` in `split_offset_mls`
   1. For each segment `(a,b)` in `item_ls`
      1. For each segment `(u,v)` of `input_linestring`
         - Find `a_proj` and `b_proj` by projecting `a` and `b` onto segment `(u,v)`
         - Adjust the projected points such that `a_proj` and `b_proj` lie **at** or **between** `u` and `v`
         - Find `a_dist` by computing `magnitude(a_proj - a)`
         - Find `b_dist` by computing `magnitude(b_proj - b)`
         - if either `a_dist` or `b_dist` is less than the absolute value of `d` then
            - if `a_dist > b_dist`add `a_proj` to `cut_targets`
            - Otherwise, add `b_proj` to `cut_targets`  
1. Repeat Algorithm 4.1.2
1. Remove zero length segments and empty linestrings etc 
1. Join remaining linestrings that are touching to form new linestring(s)
