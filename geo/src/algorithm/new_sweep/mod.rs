// This module implements the Bentley-Ottmann sweep line algorithm for efficiently finding
// line segment intersections, exposed through the [`Intersections`] iterator.
//
// Algorithm Flow
//
// 1. Collection:
//    - Line segments are collected and stored in `Intersections.segments`
//    - The `compute` method calls `compute_sweep_intersections` to process all segments.
//
// 2. Sweep Setup:
//    - Creates a new `SweepLineIndex` to manage the sweep process
//    - For each segment, creates a `SweepLineInterval` with min/max x-values
//    - Each interval generates two events: `INSERT` at left end, `DELETE` at right end.
//
// 3. Sweep Execution:
//    - `build_index` sorts all events by `x` coordinate (and type for equal `x` values)
//    - Links paired INSERT/DELETE events via array indices for efficient tracking
//    - `compute_intersections` iterates through Insert events in sorted order
//    - For each INSERT event, it examines only events between it and its paired DELETE event
//    - It filters these for other INSERT events where intervals potentially overlap (using `intervals_overlap`)
//    - For each potential overlap, `line_intersection` checks for actual geometric intersection
//    - When found, intersections are stored in `intersection_pairs`.

/// Iterator over all intersections of a collection of [`Line`]s.
///
/// # Performance Note
///
/// This implementation is most useful when there is a need to efficiently find sparse intersections
/// between thousands of line segments. For smaller numbers of segments, a brute-force approach
/// will be around 30 % faster in current tests.
///
/// Yields tuples `(`Line`, `Line`, `LineIntersection`)` for each pair of input
/// lines that intersect or overlap. This is a drop-in
/// replacement for computing [`LineIntersection`] over all pairs of
/// the collection, with the perf caveat noted above.
///
/// The implementation uses the [Bentley-Ottmann] sweep line algorithm,
/// which runs in `O((n + k) log n)` time, where `n` is the number of line segments
/// and `k` is the number of intersections.
///
/// # Examples

/// # Event Relationships
///
/// Each line segment generates two events: an `INSERT` event at its left end and
/// a `DELETE` event at its right end. These paired events need to reference each other.
///
/// Rather than using references (which would require lifetimes and possibly self-references),
/// events are stored in a single `Vec` and refer to each other using array indices:
///
/// * `insert_event`: In a `DELETE` event, stores the index of its paired `INSERT` event
/// * `delete_event_index`: In an `INSERT` event, stores the index of its paired `DELETE` event
///
/// These indices are established in `build_index()`, which uses a HashMap to efficiently
/// match events with the same interval index in O(1) time. This approach provides a simple
/// way to navigate between related events without the complexity of ownership or borrowing.
///
/// # Implementation Note: Why No Binary Search Tree or Priority Queue?
///
/// The Bentley-Ottmann algorithm as described typically uses two tracking data structures:
///
/// 1. A **priority queue** to process events in coordinate order
/// 2. A **balanced binary search tree** to track active segments sorted by their `y`-coordinate position
///
/// This implementation avoids both:
///
/// - Instead of a priority queue, the **event array is sorted once** and processes events in order.
///   This has the same asymptotic complexity.
///
/// - Instead of a binary search tree, we use **array indices as bidirectional "pointers"** between
///   related events with HashMap lookups for O(1) matching. When processing an `INSERT` event,
///   we directly examine all events between it and its paired `DELETE` event.
///
/// By establishing the relationship between INSERT and DELETE events using
/// a HashMap for fast lookups, it is possible to efficiently determine which segments are active
/// at any point _without_ maintaining an "active segment" tree.
