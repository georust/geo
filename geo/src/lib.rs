#![doc(html_logo_url = "https://raw.githubusercontent.com/georust/meta/master/logo/logo.png")]
//! The `geo` crate provides geospatial primitive types such as `Coordinate`, `Point`, `LineString`, and `Polygon` as
//! well as their `Multi–` equivalents, and provides algorithms and operations such as:
//!   - Area and centroid calculation
//!   - Simplification and convex hull operations
//!   - Distance measurement
//!   - Intersection checks
//!   - Affine transforms such as rotation and translation.
//!
//! The primitive types also provide the basis for other functionality in the `Geo` ecosystem, including:
//!   - Serialization to and from [GeoJSON](https://docs.rs/geojson) and [WKT](https://docs.rs/wkt)
//!   - [Coordinate transformation and projection](https://docs.rs/proj)
//!   - [Geocoding](https://docs.rs/geocoding)
//!   - [Working with GPS data](https://docs.rs/gpx)
//!
//! …allowing these crates to interoperate; GeoJSON can readily be read from a file, deserialised, transformed
//! to a local datum, modified, transformed back to `WGS84`, and serialised back to GeoJSON.
//!
//! Operations available for primitive types can be found in the `algorithm` module, along with
//! comprehensive usage examples.
//!
//! While `Geo` is primarily intended to operate on **planar** geometries, some other useful algorithms are
//! provided: Haversine, Frechet, and Vincenty distances, as well as Chamberlain-Duquette area.
//!
//! ## Optional Features (these can be activated in your `cargo.toml`)
//! The following optional features are available:
//! - `use-proj`: enable coordinate conversion and transformation of `Point` geometries using the [`proj`](https://docs.rs/proj) crate
//! - `use-serde`: enable serialisation of geometries using `serde`.
//!
//! ## GeoJSON
//! If you wish to read or write `GeoJSON`, use the [`geojson`](https://docs.rs/geojson) crate, with the `geo-types` feature activated.
//! This provides fallible conversions **to** `geo-types` primitives such as `Point` and `Polygon` from `geojson` `Value`
//! structs using the standard [`TryFrom`](https://doc.rust-lang.org/stable/std/convert/trait.TryFrom.html)
//! and [`TryInto`](https://doc.rust-lang.org/stable/std/convert/trait.TryInto.html) traits,
//! and conversion **from** `geo-types` primitives to `geojson`
//! `Value` structs using the [`From`](https://doc.rust-lang.org/stable/std/convert/trait.TryFrom.html) trait.
