# geo

## Geospatial Primitives, Algorithms, and Utilities

The `geo` crate provides geospatial primitive types such as `Point`, `LineString`, and `Polygon`, and provides algorithms and operations such as:
- Area and centroid calculation
- Simplification and convex hull operations
- Euclidean and Haversine distance measurement
- Intersection checks
- Affine transforms such as rotation and translation.

Please refer to [the documentation](https://docs.rs/geo) for a complete list.

The primitive types also provide the basis for other functionality in the `Geo` ecosystem, including:

- [Coordinate transformation and projection](https://github.com/georust/proj)
- Serialization to and from [GeoJSON](https://github.com/georust/geojson) and [WKT](https://github.com/georust/wkt)
- [Geocoding](https://github.com/georust/geocoding)
- [Working with GPS data](https://github.com/georust/gpx)

## Example

```rust
// primitives
use geo::{line_string, polygon};

// algorithms
use geo::ConvexHull;

// An L shape
let poly = polygon![
    (x: 0.0, y: 0.0),
    (x: 4.0, y: 0.0),
    (x: 4.0, y: 1.0),
    (x: 1.0, y: 1.0),
    (x: 1.0, y: 4.0),
    (x: 0.0, y: 4.0),
    (x: 0.0, y: 0.0),
];

// Calculate the polygon's convex hull
let hull = poly.convex_hull();

assert_eq!(
    hull.exterior(),
    &line_string![
        (x: 4.0, y: 0.0),
        (x: 4.0, y: 1.0),
        (x: 1.0, y: 4.0),
        (x: 0.0, y: 4.0),
        (x: 0.0, y: 0.0),
        (x: 4.0, y: 0.0),
    ]
);
```
