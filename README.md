# geo

## Geospatial Primitives, Algorithms, and Utilities

The `geo` crate provides geospatial primitive types such as `Point`, `LineString`, and `Polygon`, and provides algorithms and operations such as:
- Area and centroid calculation
- Simplification and convex hull operations
- Euclidean and Haversine distance measurement
- Intersection checks
- Transformation to and from PostGIS types
- Affine transforms such as rotation and translation.

Please refer to [the documentation](https://docs.rs/geo) for a complete list.

The primitive types also provide the basis for other functionality in the `Geo` ecosystem, including:

- [Coordinate transformation and projection](https://github.com/georust/proj)
- Serialization to and from [GeoJSON](https://github.com/georust/geojson) and [WKT](https://github.com/georust/wkt)
- [Geocoding](https://github.com/georust/geocoding)
- [Working with GPS data](https://github.com/georust/gpx)

## Example

```rust
use geo::{line_string, polygon};
use geo::convexhull::ConvexHull;

// An L shape
let poly = polygon![
    (x: 0.0, y: 0.0),
    (x: 4.0, y: 0.0),
    (x: 4.0, y: 1.0),
    (x: 1.0, y: 1.0),
    (x: 1.0, y: 4.0),
    (x: 0.0, y: 4.0),
    (x: 0.0, y: 0.0),
];

// Ccalculate the polygon's convex hull
let hull = poly.convex_hull();

assert_eq!(hull.exterior(), line_string![
    (x: 0.0, y: 0.0),
    (x: 0.0, y: 4.0),
    (x: 1.0, y: 4.0),
    (x: 4.0, y: 1.0),
    (x: 4.0, y: 0.0),
    (x: 0.0, y: 0.0),
]);
```
